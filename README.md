## Welcome to The Kitchen Sink!
Here you will find toolkits, learning, and practice resources for Open-Source Intelligence investigations. These resources have been gathered from all corners of the internet. There are a ton of resources at your disposal **INCLUDING THE KITCHEN SINK**. The Kitchen Sink is constantly being updated and refined with new tools, information, and resources.

If you would like to contribute a resource to The Kitchen Sink or report that a resource is no longer working, please submit your request(s) in the [issues](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/issues) section or create a pull request.

## OSINTials
I have created a toolkit of OSINT essentials (OSINTials) to help you during your investigations and research. The toolkit is pieced together from various toolkits and resources, prioritizing quality over quantity. It is primarily focused in the context of OSINT for people, though it has many uses. If you would like a corresponding set of bookmarks they can be found [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/tree/main/Bookmarks).

## Masterlists
I have a created a masterlists section where various OSINT toolkits and resources can be found known as The Dump. If you're looking for a particular toolkit or want to expand your own this is the place to do it.

## Want to learn?
Many people interested in Open-Source Intelligence are unsure where to begin, the amount of resources and knowledge can be overwhelming. Because of this I have a made a section for resources to help get you started developing your OSINT skillset. This section is known as The Library, check it out to help you learn a few tricks of the trade.

## The Wiki
In addition to the learning resources found in The Library I have created a wiki where you can find detailed walk-throughs and write-ups of various OSINT techniques.

## Where do I practice?
Once you've started researching and developing your OSINT skillset you'll want to refine it. The Training Arena was created with this in mind. Here you'll find a list of resources and challenges for you to practice your OSINT skillset.

Thanks for checking out The Kitchen Sink, stay a while!
